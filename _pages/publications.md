Hi! My name is Rui Hu (胡睿 in Chinese).

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/index.html).

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my Bachelor’s degree from Tsinghua University in Computer Science and Technology.

Research Interest
======
My research interests lie broadly in understanding modern machine learning algorithms, with a recent focus on reinforcement learning and generative flow networks. I am very open to other topics, so feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or chat!
